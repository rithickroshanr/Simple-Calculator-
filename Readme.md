A clean, minimalist calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates basic web development skills and provides a functional tool for everyday arithmetic.

## Features

*   **Basic Arithmetic:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
*   **Responsive Design:** Works well on various screen sizes (though primarily designed for desktop/tablet).
*   **Clear & Delete:** Buttons to clear the current entry (`Del`) and clear all (`Clr`).
*   **Decimal Support:** Perform calculations with decimal numbers.
*   **Percentage Functionality:** Calculate percentages easily.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the calculator.
*   **CSS3:** For styling and layout, making the calculator visually appealing.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** For all the calculator's logic and interactivity.
